 Crop prediction is a critical task for farmers and decision-makers in the agricultural
 sector. The ability to accurately forecast suitable crops for cultivation based on
 environmental and soil parameters can significantly impact agricultural productivity
 and profitability. This project aims to address this challenge by developing a crop
 prediction model that leverages machine learning techniques to provide farmers
 with informed recommendations.
 The primary objective of this project is to assist farmers in selecting the most
 suitable crops for cultivation by analyzing predicted rainfall, soil contents, and
 weather parameters. By considering these factors, the model can predict the crops
 that are likely to thrive under specific conditions. Moreover, the model provides
 additional insights such as the required fertilizers (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and
 Potassium) in kilograms per hectare and the necessary seed quantity in kilograms
 per acre for the recommended crop.
 
 1.2 Purpose
 This project aims to empower farmers with accurate information for making crop
 selection decisions. By recommending crops suitable for prevailing environmental
 conditions, farmers can optimize their practices and improve yields. The system
 also provides market prices and approximate yields for the recommended crop,
 enabling farmers to consider profitability. The crop prediction model utilizes the
 Random Forest Classifier algorithm, known for its accuracy in handling complex
 datasets. By training the model on historical crop data and environmental
 parameters, it can learn patterns and correlations. The integration of the model into
 a user-friendly web application enhances its accessibility and usability, benefiting
 farmers in their decision-making process.
 In conclusion, this project develops a crop prediction model that leverages machine
 learning and historical data to provide accurate recommendations based on
 environmental parameters. The model's integration into a web application
 empowers farmers to make informed decisions about crop selection, optimizing
 their practices and increasing profitability# flask-projects
